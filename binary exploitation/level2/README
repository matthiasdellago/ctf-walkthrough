After looking for a buffer overflow for a few days, i decided to fuzz the choice function.

For input "1234" the REPL returned "invalid input: 210".
I realised it must be an integer overflow since 1234 mod 1024 = 210.
I then tried 1027 since that is 3 modulo 1024. -> shell

After looking at the code a bit i saw the integer overflow, and that it actually overflows after 256.
