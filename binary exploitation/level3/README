The vuln: when reading the username from input, get_string_from_user() mistakenly writes to the passwords buffer, while using the USERNAME_BUFFER_SIZE. -> Overflow.

The exploit: conveniently the address of the function used for checking the credentials (test_authenticate_admin) is placed and called on the stack within the range we can overwrite with this overflow. we can simly replace the address with the address of test_start_admin_console, which we can find with gdb (> info address test_start_admin_console) = 0x4012ee.

We looked at the assembly code to see how much padding we will need to to get from the password buffer to the pointer to test_authenticate_admin.
we found that 0x40(%rsp) is the location of the buffer and 0x78(%rsp) is the location of the pointer. 0x78 - 0x40 = 0x38 = 3*16 +8 = 56.
