Main idea: Start echo service, canary vulnerable to brute force since fork server, bufferoverflow with canary, redirect to admin_console(), enter l33t

Significant obstacles along the waz:
-Took a long time to realise brute force was the right approach.
-First tried to gauge success based on output on the server side, didn't work well.
-Made a mistake by adding the address of admin_console right after canary, forgetting about the frame pointer inbetween the canary and the return address.
-Frustrating: returning to the admin_console() address did not work. I had to return to an higher address, skipping one or two lines of assembly instructions. Very annoying.
-Also frustrating: thought I would simply send l33t through the open connection after redirecting to admin console. Didn't work. Took me way too long to realise that the shell is opened in the runing echo_service process and that I simply had to enter l33t there.
