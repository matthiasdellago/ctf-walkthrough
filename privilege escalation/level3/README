Vulnerability is in strcpy. Doesn't check if source is larger than target.
Conveniently strcpy is after the security checks.
This way we can bypass the check if the acessed binary is in the right directory and within our permissions.
We pretend to want to acess uniq, and afterwards overflow l33t into the filename buffer from the argument buffer.
